# 🛡️ Complete Cybersecurity Foundation Notes

**Beginner → Professional Cyber Path (Structured Study Material)**

# 📍 PART 1: Linux Security Foundation

## 1️⃣ Linux Security Model

Linux follows a **layered security architecture**:

Layers:

1. User Layer
2. Permission Layer
3. Process Layer
4. Service Layer
5. Network Layer
6. Logging Layer
7. Kernel Layer

Security Principle:

> "No user should have more access than required."

---

## 2️⃣ Users, Groups & Identity

### User:

* Individual system identity
* Has UID (User ID)
* Owns files
* Has permissions

### Group:

* Collection of users
* Used for shared access
* Permission management

### Files:

Each file has:

* Owner
* Group
* Permission set

---

## 3️⃣ Permission System

### Structure:

```
Type | Owner | Group | Others
```

### Symbols:

* r → read
* w → write
* x → execute

### Numeric Model:

| Number | Permission |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 0      | ---        |
| 4      | r--        |
| 6      | rw-        |
| 7      | rwx        |

---

## 4️⃣ Root User

### Root Capabilities:

* Full system control
* Modify kernel files
* Change permissions
* Control services
* Create/delete users

### Risk:

Root compromise = full system compromise

---

## 5️⃣ sudo vs su

### sudo:

* Temporary admin access
* Command-based privilege
* Logged activity

### su:

* Full user switch
* No command isolation

Security:
`sudo` is safer than `su`

---

# 📍 PART 2: System Security

## 6️⃣ Process Security

Processes = running programs

Commands:

* ps
* top
* htop

Security Risks:

* Malware processes
* Resource abuse
* Backdoor services

---

## 7️⃣ Service Security

Services = background programs

Control:

* systemctl

Security Risks:

* Open ports
* Vulnerable services
* Misconfiguration

---

## 8️⃣ File System Security

Sensitive Locations:

* /etc
* /var/log
* /root
* /bin

Security:

* Access restriction
* Integrity protection
* Monitoring

---

# 📍 PART 3: Authentication & Logs

## 9️⃣ Authentication System

Files:

* /etc/passwd → user info
* /etc/shadow → encrypted passwords

Security:

* Identity verification
* Access control

---

## 🔟 Logging & Auditing

Logs Location:

* /var/log

Types:

* auth.log
* syslog

Cyber Use:

* Attack detection
* Incident response
* Forensics

---

# 📍 PART 4: Network Security Basics

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Networking Concepts

* IP Address
* Ports
* Protocols
* Services

Security Meaning:

* Attack surface
* Exposure points

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Firewall Concept

Firewall = traffic controller

Linux Tools:

* ufw
* iptables

Purpose:

* Block attacks
* Control access
* Protect services

---

# 📍 PART 5: Cybersecurity Architecture

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Core Cyber Concepts

| Term            | Meaning             |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Authentication  | Who you are         |
| Authorization   | What you can access |
| Accounting      | What you did        |
| Confidentiality | Data secrecy        |
| Integrity       | Data safety         |
| Availability    | System uptime       |

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Cyber Roles

* 🔴 Red Team → Attackers
* 🔵 Blue Team → Defenders
* 🟣 Purple Team → Strategy

---

# 📍 PART 6: Cyber Learning Path

---

# 🧠 Cyber Mindset Formula

```
System Control → Access Control → Monitoring → Defense → Cybersecurity
```

---

# 🎯 Daily Cyber Practice Model

* OS practice
* Permission labs
* User labs
* Log reading
* Process analysis
* Service control

---

# 🛡️ Cyber Philosophy

> "Cybersecurity is not hacking tools, it is system understanding."
