Date: Day 1
Topic: Java Runtime Architecture & Execution Model

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS + LEARNING

1) Difference between JDK, JRE, JVM?
JDK = development kit (compiler + tools + JRE)
JRE = runtime environment (libraries + JVM)
JVM = virtual machine that executes bytecode

2) How Java code executes internally?
.java → javac → .class (bytecode) → ClassLoader → JVM → Interpreter/JIT → Machine code

3) What is bytecode and why is it important?
Bytecode is platform-independent intermediate code that runs on JVM.

4) What is ClassLoader?
Loads .class files into memory dynamically.
Types: Bootstrap, Extension, Application

5) JVM Memory Areas:
- Heap → objects
- Stack → method calls, local variables
- Method Area → class metadata, static variables
- PC Register
- Native Method Stack

6) Difference between Stack and Heap?
Stack → thread-based, fast, local  
Heap → shared, slower, objects

7) What is Garbage Collection?
Automatic memory cleanup of unused objects from heap.

8) What is JIT Compiler?
Converts bytecode to native machine code for faster execution.

9) Why Java is platform independent?
Because bytecode runs on JVM, not directly on OS.

10) Java execution flow:
Class loading → Memory allocation → main() call → Execution → GC → Program termination

DOUBTS:
- JVM vs OS
- JIT vs Interpreter
