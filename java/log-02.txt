Date: Day 2
Topic: OOPS + Object Design + Core Programming Concepts (Elaborated)

===============================
OOPS CORE TOPICS
===============================

1) What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation means binding data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to data using access modifiers (private, protected, public).
It is implemented using:
- private variables
- public getter/setter methods

Purpose:
- Data security
- Data hiding
- Controlled access
- Better maintainability

Example:
Private balance variable in BankAccount class accessed only via methods.

--------------------------------

2) What is Abstraction?
Abstraction means hiding internal implementation and showing only required functionality to the user.
It focuses on "what to do" not "how to do".

Implemented using:
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces

Purpose:
- Reduce complexity
- Increase security
- Improve scalability
- Better system design

Example:
User uses ATM machine without knowing internal processing.

--------------------------------

3) What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows one class (child) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent).
Implemented using `extends` keyword.

Purpose:
- Code reusability
- Hierarchical classification
- Reduced redundancy

Example:
Vehicle → Car → ElectricCar

--------------------------------

4) What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means one object behaving in multiple forms.
Same method name, different behavior.

Types:
- Compile-time polymorphism → Method overloading
- Runtime polymorphism → Method overriding

Purpose:
- Flexibility
- Scalability
- Dynamic behavior

Example:
Shape class → draw() method  
Circle.draw(), Square.draw(), Triangle.draw()

--------------------------------

5) Composition vs Inheritance?

Inheritance (IS-A):
- Strong coupling
- Tight dependency
- Rigid structure

Composition (HAS-A):
- Loose coupling
- Flexible design
- Better scalability

Example:
Car HAS-A Engine → Composition  
Car IS-A Vehicle → Inheritance  

Composition is preferred in real systems because it allows change without breaking structure.

--------------------------------

6) Association vs Aggregation vs Composition?

Association:
General relationship between objects.
Example: Student — Teacher

Aggregation:
Weak ownership relationship.
Child can exist without parent.
Example: Department — Professor

Composition:
Strong ownership.
Child cannot exist without parent.
Example: House — Room

===============================
INTERFACE & ABSTRACT CLASS
===============================

7) Interface:
Interface is a blueprint of class.
It supports multiple inheritance.
All methods are public and abstract by default.
Variables are public static final.

Used for:
- Loose coupling
- Multiple inheritance
- Contract-based design
- Framework architecture

--------------------------------

8) Abstract Class:
Can contain both abstract and concrete methods.
Supports constructors.
Provides partial abstraction.

Used when:
Some functionality is common
Some must be implemented by child class

--------------------------------

9) Interface vs Abstract Class (Elaborated)

Interface:
- Multiple inheritance supported
- No constructors
- Full abstraction
- Used for capability definition

Abstract Class:
- Single inheritance
- Has constructors
- Partial abstraction
- Used for base class design

===============================
DESIGN-LEVEL CONCEPTS
===============================

10) Why composition is preferred over inheritance?
Because it provides:
- Loose coupling
- Better maintainability
- Flexible architecture
- Easy modification
- Independent object lifecycle

--------------------------------

11) How does Java support loose coupling?
- Interfaces
- Dependency Injection
- Abstraction
- Factory patterns
- Service layers

--------------------------------

12) What is Dependency Injection?
It means providing dependencies from outside instead of creating them inside the class.

Benefits:
- Testability
- Loose coupling
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Better architecture

===============================
REAL SYSTEM THINKING
===============================

13) How OOPS is used in real applications?
Classes → Real entities  
Objects → Real instances  
Methods → Real operations  
Relationships → System structure  

Example:
User, Order, Payment, Product as classes in e-commerce system.

--------------------------------

14) How data security is achieved using OOPS?
- Encapsulation → data hiding
- Access modifiers → controlled access
- Abstraction → hide internal logic
- Immutability → secure objects

===============================
PROGRAMMING LOGIC (EXPLAINED)
===============================

15) Employee system using inheritance:
Base class → Employee  
Child classes → Manager, Developer, HR  
Common fields in Employee  
Special behavior in child classes

--------------------------------

16) Student Management System:
Classes:
Student, Course, Teacher, Department, Result  
Relationships:
Student HAS-A Course  
Student ASSOCIATED WITH Teacher

--------------------------------

17) BankAccount using encapsulation:
Private variables: balance, accountNo  
Public methods: deposit(), withdraw(), getBalance()

--------------------------------

18) Library System Design:
Classes:
Book, Member, Librarian, Library, Transaction

--------------------------------

19) Polymorphism example:
Shape → draw()  
Circle.draw(), Square.draw()  
Dynamic binding at runtime

--------------------------------

20) Login system using abstraction:
Abstract class AuthSystem  
Methods: login(), logout()  
Implementations: UserAuth, AdminAuth

===============================
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (ELABORATED)
===============================

21) Why Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes?
Because of Diamond Problem (ambiguity in method resolution).

--------------------------------

22) How Java supports multiple inheritance?
Using interfaces (multiple interfaces can be implemented).

--------------------------------

23) What is method hiding?
When static method in child class has same signature as parent class static method.

--------------------------------

24) Can we override private methods?
No, private methods are not visible to child class.

--------------------------------

25) What is runtime binding?
Method call resolution happens at runtime (dynamic dispatch).

--------------------------------

26) What is upcasting and downcasting?
Upcasting: Parent ref = Child object  
Downcasting: Child ref = (Child) Parent ref

--------------------------------

27) Why object creation is costly?
Memory allocation + constructor execution + reference creation + initialization

--------------------------------

28) What is tight coupling?
Strong dependency between classes.
Change in one affects another.

--------------------------------

29) What is loose coupling?
Minimal dependency.
Independent modification possible.

--------------------------------

30) How OOPS helps in scalability?
- Modular structure
- Reusable components
- Flexible architecture
- Easy expansion
- Maintainable codebase
